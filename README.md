# Bub Web Shop - Design & UI/UX Project

To continue my leanring of UI/UX and design, I am going to create a small clothing online store. 

## Features used
As this project is to show my design and UI/UX skills, there won't be many features available but the basics.   
- Adding items to cart
- View cart and total
- Scroll through new arrivals (hero section)
- ...  

Other than the web features, I will also have to show how I view brand creation, with the design part, so brand design board, logo creation and overall style.
